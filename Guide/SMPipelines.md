# SageMaker Pipelines MLOps

**Please kindly refer to the Notebook.**

SageMaker Pipelines is created to be fully integrated with SageMaker for MLOps need. To create it, it's very easy to use.

In Pipelines, we have things called `Step`, Which basically a process of what would be executed.

Several steps in SageMaker Pipeline can be checked [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html) for more details. Types of steps depends on what would be the process (Example, Training step only focus on training process)

As there are also other SageMaker Studio features, you can also integrate it with SageMaker Pipelines (Such as SageMaker Clarify to detect bias, SageMaker model Registry to register the model, and many more)
